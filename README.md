# ghenga

The ghenga micro CRM

## Getting Started

Install `vagrant` and execute `vagrant up` to download and provision the
development environment. Then use `vagrant ssh` to log into the VM.

The default vagrant base box is `ubuntu/wily64`, if you need to use Parallels
instead of VirtualBox, you can provision and use a different base image as
follows:

```shell
export GHENGA_VAGRANT_BOX=boxcutter/ubuntu1604
vagrant up
```

While the VirtualBox download is running, you can clone the [ghenga-ui
repository](https://github.com/ghenga/ghenga-ui):

```shell
git clone https://github.com/ghenga/ghenga-ui
```

Afterwards, reboot the virtual machine and log in via SSH:

```
vagrant reload
vagrant ssh
```

Then run the following commands to build and start the ghenga server:

```shell
cd ghenga/ghenga-ui
make dep && make
cd ..
gb build
bin/ghenga serve --public ghenga-ui/build
```

The database can be filled with (real-looking) fake data, including the user
accounts `admin` and `user` with the password `geheim`:

```shell
bin/ghenga fakedata
```
